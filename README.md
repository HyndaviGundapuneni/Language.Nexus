# Language.Nexus | NLP Framework

**Language.Nexus** is an advanced NLP framework designed to enable real-time multilingual translation across multiple formats: Text-Text, Text-Speech, Speech-Text, and Speech-Speech. The framework integrates technologies such as Transformers, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and Speech-to-Text (STT) for seamless, accurate translation.

## Technologies Used:
- **Transformers**
- **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)**
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**
- **Speech-to-Text (STT)**

## Features:
- **Live Translation**: Supports real-time translation in Text-Text, Text-Speech, Speech-Text, and Speech-Speech.
- **Real-time Communication**: Enables seamless voice and document translation.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved 92.3% accuracy for both text and speech translation.
- **Multilingual Support**: Designed to work across multiple languages for global communication.
